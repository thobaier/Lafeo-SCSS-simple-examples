# Weekly presentation of Lafeo SCSS (Docker version)
> This is a private backup of a internal demonstration. I decide to make it public to reference it sometimes in other projects.

If you are interested to see it in action, follow these steps:

### clone this repository in a new folder (for example "scss")
```console
git clone git@github.com:thobaier/Lafeo-SCSS-simple-examples.git scss
```

### Download dependencies
```console
cd scss/application && composer-install
```

### Compose the project
Edit the ports that they fit your needs.
```console
cd .. && docker-compose up
```

### Check out the "public" folder for some examples
```console
http://localhost/1-exapmles-simple/
```
